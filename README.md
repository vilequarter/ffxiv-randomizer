Simple web app to practice with React/Next

If you have trouble making decisions (like I do), this little randomizer will help! Built for Final Fantasy XIV,
this app will quickly choose a role for you based on configurable filters, so you don't have to agonize
over which one to focus on leveling or doing roulettes with.

The top three 'Roles' checkboxes will control which roles you wish to add to the selection, modifying the
corresponding jobs' checkboxes below.

Uncheck any boxes you don't want to be part of the selection, then click the 'Get a Job' button to randomly
highlight one of the selected jobs.

The 'Clear' button will remove the highlight, modifying any checkbox will do this as well.
